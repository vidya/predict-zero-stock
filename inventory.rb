# Our users like the chemical inventory system you built for them, but sometimes they unexpectedly
# run out of a chemical and have to wait for resupply. After discussing this with them, you realize
# that many uses recur at defined intervals, and this can help you forecast when the chemical will run out.
# 
# For this code problem, you will write the algorithm to predict when a chemical will run out. 
# Please use Ruby (core library only) and include plenty of specs/tests in your favorite testing framework.
# 
# Scheduled use
#  - A scheduled use has an amount, a periodicity, a start date and an optional end date
#  - A scheduled use's periodicity can be daily or weekly (on a particular day of the week)
#
# Given a current amount and a set of scheduled uses, predict when the chemical will run out
#  - If the last use brings the amount to zero, then return the date of the last use
#  - If any use makes the amount negative, return the date of the latest use that did not incur
#    a negative balance
